                <p1>
                    This is the beginning of the elga3 website.<br>
                    this website was made to host the different sheets and have some other interactive things.<br>
                    This mostly a process for me to learn how to create and maintain a website.<br>
                    Right now this looks like a website from the early web which makes sense as people knew quite little like i do.<br>
                    But this is hopefully a start to a wonderfull adventure that is going to give me some real relevant experience<br> 
                </p1>

                <h4> now, my plans for this website are to do the following:</h4>
            </div>
            <div>
                <div class = "tabcontent">
                    <h4>add sheets</h4>
                    Adding the sheets we currently have on google docs to the website.<br>
                    we want to do this as it would be far more efficient to have a website dedicated to this.<br>
                </div>

                <div class = "tabcontent">
                    <h4>acconuts</h4>
                    To make this happen in a safe way i might have to make some sort of account system.<br>
                    This is something that i feel can be quite scary to do as i am worried about security.<br>
                    I also dont really know how to do something like this so might happen a while into the project.<br>
                </div>

                <div class = "tabcontent">
                    <h4>personal subsites</h4>
                    When that has been done i would like for the server to be able to edit the website in some easy way.<br>
                    like make subsites easily where they can have images and text and whatever, just for fun.<br>
                </div>

                <div class = "tabcontent">
                    <h4>full controll</h4>
                    This is basically just going to be a way for the server to have some cool website<br>
                    with shit to do on it, we are already using the sheets, and having a website<br>
                    which we have 100% controll over would be great.<br>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
