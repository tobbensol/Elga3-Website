                ELGA-3
            </h1>
    
            <p1>
                This is the beginning of the elga3 website.<br>
                The intention is for this to host the gamesheet, music sheet and have some other interactive things.<br>
                This mostly a process for me to learn how to create and maintain a website.<br>
                Right now this looks like a website from the early web which makes sense as people knew quite little.<br>
                But this is hopefully a start to a wonderfull adventure that is going to give me some real relevant experience<br>

        <div class="list">
            <div>
                <h4> now, my plans for this website is to test out a lot of different website things like:</h4>
                <div class=listitem>
                    <li>
                        add sheets
                    </li>

                    <p1>
                        Adding the sheets we currently have on google docs to the website.<br>
                        This is not because the sheets dont work, they work wonderfully.<br>
                        It would just be a lot more efficient to make some sort of website dedicated to this.<br>
                    </p1>
                </div>


                <div class = "Listitem">
                    <li>
                        add accounts
                    </li>

                    <p1>
                        To make this happen in a safe way i might have to make some sort of account system. <br>
                        This is something that i feel can be quite scary to do as i am worried about security.<br>
                        I also dont really know how to do something like this so might happen a while into the project.<br>
                    </p1>
                </div>

                <div class = "listitem">
                    <li>
                        add personal subsites
                    </li>

                    <p1>
                        When that has been done i would like for the server to be able to edit the website in some easy way. <br>
                        like make subsites easily where they can have images and text and whatever, just for fun. <br>
                    </p1>
                </div>

                <div class = listitem>
                    <li>
                        sheet efficency
                    </li>
                        
                    <p1>
                        This is basically just going to be a way for the server to have some cool website<br>
                        with shit to do on it, we are already using the sheets, and having a website<br>
                        which we have 100% controll over would be great.
