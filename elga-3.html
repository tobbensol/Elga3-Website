            <div>
                <p1>
                    This is the beginning of the elga3 website.<br>
                    this website was made to host the different sheets and have some other interactive things.<br>
                    This mostly a process for me to learn how to create and maintain a website.<br>
                    Right now this looks like a website from the early web which makes sense as people knew quite little like i do.<br>
                    But this is hopefully a start to a wonderfull adventure that is going to give me some real relevant experience<br> 
                </p1>

                <h4> now, my plans for this website are to do the following:</h4>
            </div>

            <div class="tab">
                <button class="tablinks" onclick="openCity(event, 'add sheets')">add sheets</button>
                <button class="tablinks" onclick="openCity(event, 'add accounts')">add accounts</button>
                <button class="tablinks" onclick="openCity(event, 'add personal subsites')">add personal subsites</button>
                <button class="tablinks" onclick="openCity(event, 'full controll')">full controll</button>
            </div>

            <div id="add sheets" class = "tabcontent">
                Adding the sheets we currently have on google docs to the website.
                we want to do this as it would be far more efficient to have a website dedicated to this.
            </div>

            <div id="add accounts" class = "tabcontent">
                To make this happen in a safe way i might have to make some sort of account system.
                This is something that i feel can be quite scary to do as i am worried about security.
                I also dont really know how to do something like this so might happen a while into the project.
            </div>

            <div id="add personal subsites" class = "tabcontent">
                When that has been done i would like for the server to be able to edit the website in some easy way.
                    like make subsites easily where they can have images and text and whatever, just for fun.
            </div>

            <div id="full controll" class = "tabcontent">
                This is basically just going to be a way for the server to have some cool website
                with shit to do on it, we are already using the sheets, and having a website
                which we have 100% controll over would be great.
            </div>

        </div>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="tab.js"></script>
    </body>
